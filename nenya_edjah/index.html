      <hr />

      <p>
        Good morning everyone, I'm Teddy. I was Nenya's roommate for 3 years in
        college.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's funny: I'm not usually one to remember the first time I meet a
        person. But in these past few weeks, as I've had the time to reflect and
        remember, our first meeting has jumped out sharply and distinctly in my
        memory. And I want to share that with you all today.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the first semester of freshman year at Harvard. I, like many
        other freshman, was taking CS 50, our intro computer science class. A
        month into the class, our homework for the week was to build a
        spellchecker. That in itself wasn't very interesting, but&#8230; there
        was a leaderboard. An ultimate test of who among the freshman noobs was
        "best." I toiled for hours, neglecting all my other classes, and after a
        week, I had risen to the top of the leaderboard. There were only two
        names above mine: Nenya's and above him, Rob Bowden, one of the teaching
        fellows.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not sure what compelled me &#8212; maybe it was a sense of
        competitiveness, curiosity, or desire for new friends &#8212; but I sent
        a message to Nenya on FB. My message said, "Yo fam, I admire your work
        on the CS50 psets." It was an invitation to join forces to topple Rob
        from the leaderboard. To my surprise, he responded and agreed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We met in Lamont Cafe soon after and the conversation flowed fluidly. We
        exchanged the unique insights we had independently discovered and
        integrated them into each other's code. And we kept brainstorming new
        ideas, coming up with hacks and optimizations that we could use to gain
        any edge we possibly could. We kept talking, pushing our code to the
        limit in the days after. By the end, we had usurped Rob and taken the
        top two spots: me in second and, of course, Nenya in first.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were inseparable from that point forward. The rest of CS 50 was an
        absolute blur: solving puzzles and taking goofy photos on puzzle day,
        winning the CS 50 Programming Contest, staying on campus for winter
        break and building our "pseudocode parser" that could turn English into
        code. And then the semesters after that: taking many of the same
        courses, becoming roommates, joining and rebuilding the Crimson's
        website, countless final projects, late nights, McDonald's chicken
        nugget orders, and Super Smash Bros games.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through it all, our friendship continued to deepen. We were always
        either collaborating, competing, or joking, sometimes all 3 at once! We
        were joined at the hip; some even jokingly observed we operated as an
        old married couple with the amount of bickering we did.
      </p>

      <p>
        What struck me about Nenya as we got closer as friends was the variety
        of roles he played in my life and the ease with which he switched
        between them. I look around at the people here today, and I know that he
        played similar roles in many of your lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was Nenya the teacher. Even when we were taking the same course,
        if I ever didn't understand a concept, he could break it down and help
        me grok it. And when we were TFs for a multitude of computer science
        courses, he was everyone's favorite TF. The TF who always knew all the
        answers and could actually help you understand how to arrive at the
        answer. The TF who had infinite patience and who would spend extra time
        long after office hours were over to make sure that everyone was
        attended to.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was Nenya the mentor. In the Crimson, he was the role model many
        looked up to. He worked with everyone to develop their professional and
        coding skills. He always seemed to have the most grounded career advice
        and believed in everyone's potential. He was everyone's cheerleader, and
        he never accepted anything less than your best: a standard he also held
        himself to.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was Nenya the pure wonderkid. The guy who was always acing classes
        and psets, even without ever taking notes in lecture! The guy who would
        always top any and every code leaderboard in class, be it in efficiency,
        speed, accuracy, or elegance. The guy who was landing the coolest and
        most lucrative internships and jobs. The guy who could build any
        application or program as long as he put his mind to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was Nenya the collaborator and partner. One of the few people I
        worked on everything with. We were building new programming languages,
        weird machine learning models and paradigms, and rearchitecting an
        entire newspaper's website. He was always pushing ambitious, boundary
        redefining ideas, and we had each other's trust in making those things a
        reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        And finally, there was Nenya, my roommate and everyone's friend. The one
        stealing from my salt and vinegar chips stash sophomore year. The one
        who taught me how to play Dota. The one who was always down to play
        Super Smash Bros and order 20 chicken nuggets at 3 in the morning. The
        one I could talk to about anything: even share some of my deepest
        insecurities. The one who could make all of us laugh with his jokes and
        antics.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was Nenya. The impossibly smart, ambitious, compassionate, kind,
        and irreplaceable person that I got to know over the last 6 years. And I
        just feel so incredibly lucky to have seen him in all his facets and
        call him one of my closest friends. My best friend.
      </p>

      <p>
        I want to close by sharing a common theme that has come up in the last
        few weeks as I've talked with many of the friends and people that Nenya
        impacted. It comes in two parts. First, I truly believed Nenya was going
        to change the world. He had the talent, ambition, charisma; it was never
        a question of if but when and what. But second, he already did change
        the world. Look at us here. We were his world. And he was a large,
        outsized part of ours. The impact he had on us is already profound and
        immeasurable, and that's enough.
      </p>

      <p>Thank you for everything, Nenya. I'm going to miss you dearly.</p>
